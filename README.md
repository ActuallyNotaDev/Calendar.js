# Calendar.js
Calendar.js provide a fast way to work with dates when you don't wanna deal with hours, minute, second and so on.
It means that Calendar.js comes in handy when you wanna work with something like a 'calendar based app' or maybe you need some date system for a browser.
The output is really easy-to-use: once you had import the module, instantiate a calendar object, set a year range and you get a json with a ordered list containing all the days belonging to those years.

## Import
You have a couple of way to import the package:

### Copy the raw js  
The simplest way is to grab the raw js from https://github.com/ActuallyNotaDev/Calendar.js/blob/main/calendar.js,
make a new js file, paste it.
after that from your entry script:

```javascript
import calendar from '<PATH>/calendar.js';

var ðŸ“… = new calendar()
```
---

### Via npm

> npm package will be avabile soon

---

## Usage
calendar use a ```ðŸ“….set( first_year, last_year )``` function to inizialize a calendar that goes from one year(```first_year```) to another(```last_year```). Once done you can quickly get your calendar.
```javascript
// let's get the calendar from 1997 to 2007
ðŸ“….set( 1997, 2007 )

console.log(console.log(`this is the calendar from 1987 to  1999` ); )
console.log(ðŸ“….getCalendar())
```
The output, if you are testing on a browser should be like this:

<img src="https://github.com/ActuallyNotaDev/ActuallyNotaDev/blob/main/Doc/OUTPUTgetCalendar2.png" width="600" height="400" />

Now each listed object ***rappresent a year*** with ***all his days*** also in the form of a list:

<img src="https://github.com/ActuallyNotaDev/ActuallyNotaDev/blob/main/Doc/OUTPUTgetCalendar1.png" width="570" height="250" /> 

## Get a specific day

At this point we can point to a certain position to ***get a specific day***:

```javascript
console.log(`The PlayStation is launched by Sony in Japan ðŸŽ® : ` );
ðŸ“….pointDay(12,3,1990)

console.log(ðŸ“….getPointedDay());
```
Output:

## browse between days

Passing an ```Int``` the function below provide a more declarative way to move the pointer:

```javascript
console.log(ðŸ“….addDays(10)); 
console.log(ðŸ“….subDays(3));

```
Output :
